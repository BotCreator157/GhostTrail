# GhostTrail – A Personal Movement for Anonymous Payments

I built something alone.  
Not to be famous — but to create space for people like me.

It’s called **GhostTrail**.

A backend crypto payment facilitator that supports **BTC**, **ETH**, and **TRON-based USDT**  
with **no KYC**, no analytics, and no surveillance.  
It’s attached to a Telegram bot — but the real magic is in the backend.

- Every wallet is encrypted
- Every user has a private hash ID
- All wallets can be deleted and recreated
- Balance checks and payment delays are built in
- Built using **testnets**: Sepolia (ETH), Signet (BTC), Shasta (TRON)

This is about **privacy**. Real privacy.  
No cloud APIs. No snooping. Just full user control.

I’m raising **$50,000** to:

- Host my own BTC, ETH, and TRON full nodes  
- Build VPS infrastructure without relying on cloud providers  
- Upgrade the system to include deeper obfuscation and privacy techniques  
- Bring in backend students and self-taught devs to help grow this into a true movement

**No one helped me build it.**  
But I'm building it for all of us.

GhostTrail — Privacy as Default.
