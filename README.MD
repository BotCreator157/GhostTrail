# ✅ GhostTrail – Anonymous Crypto Payment Facilitator

*A Node.js backend system enabling private, anonymous BTC, ETH, and USDT transactions — no KYC, no third-party APIs.*

---

## 🌐 What Is GhostTrail?

GhostTrail is a backend crypto payment facilitator that supports **Bitcoin**, **Ethereum**, and **TRON-based USDT** transactions.  
There’s **no KYC**, no central API dependency, and it’s designed to be deployable by anyone.  

Currently, the backend powers a Telegram bot as an MVP to showcase its full capabilities.

## 👻 Why It Exists

## 👤 About the Creator

I’m a self-taught developer on a journey to build tools that protect privacy in a world that often forgets its value.

While I’m still learning backend and frontend development, I’m passionate about creating something meaningful — a platform where users can control their crypto anonymously, without KYC, trackers, or surveillance.

I chose Telegram as the launchpad despite its reputation for scams because it has immense reach and flexible bot features. I want to prove that it’s possible to build **trustworthy**, **privacy-first** solutions here.

GhostTrail is my proof of concept and an invitation to everyone who values financial privacy: let’s build a better, safer crypto ecosystem — together.

> I built this for **privacy** — for the anonymous space we’ve all lost.  
>
> In a world where transactions are constantly traced, sold, or watched, GhostTrail is a stand against surveillance.  
>
> This is for the builders, the misfits, and the people who just want to **transact freely** without fear or exposure.
