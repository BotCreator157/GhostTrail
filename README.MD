# ✅ GhostTrail – Anonymous Crypto Payment Facilitator
*A Node.js backend system enabling private, anonymous BTC, ETH, and USDT transactions — no KYC, no third-party APIs.*

---

## 🌐 What Is GhostTrail?

GhostTrail is a backend crypto payment facilitator that supports **Bitcoin**, **Ethereum**, and **TRON-based USDT** transactions. There’s **no KYC**, no central API dependency, and it’s meant to be deployable by anyone. While the backend is the core, it's currently attached to a Telegram bot to serve as an MVP and showcase its full capabilities.

## 👻 Why It Exists

> I built this for **privacy** — for the anonymous space we’ve all lost.  
>
> In a world where transactions are constantly traced, sold, or watched, GhostTrail is a stand against surveillance.  
>
> This is for the builders, the misfits, and the people who just want to **transact freely** without fear or exposure.

## 💡 Why $50,000?

GhostTrail is a testnet prototype now — $50,000 will turn it into a real, powerful tool for privacy-minded users.

With that support, I’ll:

- 🧩 Deploy full BTC, ETH, and TRON nodes
- 🛠️ Build private infrastructure (no cloud surveillance)
- 🔐 Upgrade wallet architecture for deeper privacy
- 🧑‍💻 Bring in backend students/devs to grow the project

If you're a builder or believer in privacy — test it, fork it, build on it.
