✅ GhostTrail – Anonymous Crypto Payment Facilitator
A Node.js backend system enabling private, anonymous BTC, ETH, and USDT transactions — no KYC, no third-party APIs.

🌐 What Is GhostTrail?
GhostTrail is a backend crypto payment facilitator that supports Bitcoin (Signet), Ethereum (Sepolia), and USDT on TRON (Shasta) transactions — all on testnets for now.
There’s no KYC, no central API dependency, and it’s designed to be deployable by anyone. Currently, the backend is connected to a Telegram bot serving as an MVP to showcase its full capabilities.

👻 Why It Exists
I built this for privacy — to reclaim the anonymous space we’ve all lost.
In a world where transactions are constantly traced, sold, or watched, GhostTrail is a stand against surveillance.

This project is for the builders, the misfits, and the people who just want to transact freely without fear or exposure.

GhostTrail doesn’t want your data — it only wants to empower you to control your crypto without revealing your identity.
